# Creating a Fast API application
 FastAPI applications are created by importing the necessary modules and using Python functions and decorators to define routes and their corresponding functions. A route is a URL pattern that maps to a Python function, which handles the logic for that route. Here's an example: 

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
```
